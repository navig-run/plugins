"""
CDP action layer — the single implementation behind both `navig cdp` (CLI) and
the ``cdp_*`` MCP tools.

Every function attaches (or reuses) a live session via
:func:`~navig.browser.session_manager.get_session_manager` and drives the target
through the public :class:`~navig.browser.controller.BrowserController` API. Both
surfaces call these, so there is exactly one code path — no duplication.

Return values are plain JSON-able dicts with an ``ok`` flag, so the CLI can
pretty-print and MCP can hand them straight to the agent.
