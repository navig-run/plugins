"""Coherent browser fingerprint generation from a curated pool of whole machines.

A fingerprint is only useful if it's *coherent* — the UA, UA-CH, platform, screen,
hardware, languages, timezone and geo must agree, and (Stage 7) agree with the proxy's
geo and the yt-dlp ``impersonate`` target too. This module produces one coherent
:class:`Fingerprint`, deterministically from a seed so a profile's identity is **stable**
across runs (persona reuse), and exposes two application surfaces:

- :func:`to_context_options` — coherence-SAFE Playwright context opts (``locale`` /
  ``timezone_id`` / ``geolocation``). Safe to apply on any engine, including Patchright.
- :func:`to_init_script` — the JS shim layer (navigator/screen/WebGL/canvas). Powerful for
  vanilla Playwright, but layering it on Patchright can *contradict* its engine-level
  patches, so callers apply it only on non-Patchright tiers.

Identities come from ``_PROFILES`` — a curated pool where each entry is an internally
coherent machine (see the note there). BrowserForge was tried here and removed (#172): it
could give a realistic distribution OR a coherent, seed-stable, Chrome-only identity, never
both. The curated pool wins on every axis that matters here — see the comment above
:func:`generate`.

# Curated, internally-coherent desktop profiles. Each entry is a WHOLE MACHINE: the UA,
# navigator.platform, UA-CH platform, WebGL vendor/renderer, and the hardware envelope
# (screen resolutions, logical cores, device memory) all describe the same plausible box.
#
# Why the hardware lives on the profile and is no longer drawn from global pools:
# ``screen``/``hardware_concurrency``/``device_memory`` used to be picked independently of
# the OS, so a macOS/Apple-M2 identity could come out with 4 cores (an M2 has 8) on a
# 1536×864 Windows-scaling resolution — an incoherent machine a detector spots by
# correlating navigator.platform × screen × deviceMemory × hardwareConcurrency × WebGL.
#
# Two hard invariants, both enforced by tests:
#   * ``memory`` values are valid ``navigator.deviceMemory`` buckets — Chrome CAPS this at
#     8 and rounds to a power of two, so 16 (which the old pool contained) can never appear
#     in a real browser and was itself a tell.
#   * ``chrome`` is a version curl_cffi can actually impersonate at the TLS layer. The old
#     pool shipped ``chrome130``, which curl_cffi does NOT support — so persona.impersonate
#     ("chrome130") was an unsatisfiable target. Keep these to curl_cffi's desktop set
#     (see tests/browser/test_fingerprint_pool_coherence.py, which reads it live).
#
# WebGL renderer strings use the real formats current Chrome emits: Direct3D11/ANGLE on
# Windows, the Metal renderer on Apple Silicon. UA freezes "Mac OS X 10_15_7" on macOS by
# design (Chrome's UA reduction), so that is correct on every macOS version.

# ── Why there is no BrowserForge here any more ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `generate()` used to try BrowserForge FIRST and fall back to the curated `_PROFILES`
# pool. It broke both of this module's hard contracts, silently, whenever BrowserForge
# happened to be importable (it ships as a camoufox dependency, so that is the normal
# case):
#
#   * DETERMINISM — it was called with no seed at all, so it returned a fresh random
#     identity on EVERY call and the caller's seed was ignored outright. `build("work")`
#     handed back a different device each time. A per-profile identity exists precisely so
#     it does NOT rotate mid-session; rotating it is what gets a session flagged. The
#     existing determinism tests passed by LUCK, because BrowserForge's distribution is
#     dominated by Windows Chrome and two consecutive draws usually coincided.
#
#   * COHERENCE — everything downstream hard-claims Chrome: `impersonate=chrome{major}`
#     (the TLS target), `sec_ch_ua`, `webgl_vendor="Google Inc."` / `ANGLE`. Unconstrained,
#     BrowserForge returns iPhone Safari, Android and even Firefox/Gecko profiles, and the
#     old code then fell back to a hardcoded chrome_major of "131" — shipping a Safari
#     user-agent with a Chrome TLS handshake and Chrome WebGL strings. That mismatch is
#     itself a detection signal: worse than no stealth at all.
#
# Constraining it (browser=chrome, os=windows, device=desktop) fixes coherence but collapses
# to exactly ONE user-agent across 20 seeds — fewer than the 3 the native pool already
# provides. So BrowserForge can give coherence OR variety, never both, and its full
# fingerprint object was never consumed downstream anyway. The seeded native pool is
# strictly better on every axis that matters: coherent by construction, deterministic, and
# more varied. Do not re-add BrowserForge here without solving coherence first — a
# fingerprint that contradicts itself is louder than one that is merely common.
