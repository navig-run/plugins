"""Who decided this browser should be visible — and were they in the room?

**The defect this exists to fix.** Window visibility used to be a property of the
*controller*: ``SystemChromeController(headless=False)``, ``cdp_actions.new(headless=False)``,
``StealthConfig.headless = False``. That default has a legitimate origin — ``cdp login`` and
``cdp profile open`` need a visible window so a *human* can type a password, and
``test_system_chrome.py`` pins it with the comment ``# headful by default (human login)``.

But a default set at the controller is inherited by *every* caller, including the ones with
no human attached. The MCP schema for ``cdp_new`` advertised ``"headless": {"default":
False, "description": "…opt-in…"}``, so an autonomous agent — which has no eyes and no
reason to opt in — opened a **real window on the operator's screen** on every call. Those
windows render blank, because NAVIG drives content in a tab target it then closes, and they
accumulate, because browsers are spawned ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` and outlive the CLI. The
operator watched stacks of empty windows pile up during unattended sessions.

So visibility is not the controller's business. It belongs to the **caller's context**:

    agent   an LLM/MCP/gateway call. Nobody is watching.        -> headless
    script  cron, harness, CI, batch claim jobs. Unattended.    -> headless
    human   the operator typed the command and is looking at    -> visible
            the screen (``cdp login``, ``profile open``, ``do``)

An explicit argument always wins, so ``--headed`` / ``--headless`` still mean exactly what
they say and no existing caller changes behaviour. Between the two sits one operator-level
override, ``browser.headless``.

⚠ That config key only works because ``BrowserConfig`` is declared in
``navig.core.config_schema``. ``_load_global_config(validate=True)`` returns
``GlobalConfig(...).model_dump()`` and ``GlobalConfig`` does not set ``extra="allow"``, so an
undeclared top-level key is dropped on the way out and every read of it returns the caller's
default forever. Verified before this module was written: a raw config carrying
``{"browser": {"headless": True}}`` came back from validation with no ``browser`` key at all.
Do not add a setting here without adding it to the schema too.
