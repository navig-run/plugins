"""Real-Chrome login/automation engine — a launched *system* Chrome driven over CDP.

Why this exists: NAVIG's other engines are all **automation** frameworks — Patchright/Playwright
launch with ``--enable-automation`` (so ``navigator.webdriver === true``) and Camoufox can be
unstable on heavy pages. Some sites hard-block automated logins (TikTok's login "maximum attempts"
limiter) while still accepting a **real Chrome that a human drives**. A Chrome launched with only a
debug port — *no* ``--enable-automation`` — reports ``navigator.webdriver === false`` (it looks
like a normal browser), and NAVIG drives it over CDP (``connect_over_cdp``), exactly like
``navig cdp``. Live-verified: such a Chrome loads TikTok's login page with 0 region failures.

Isolation & safety:
- Uses its OWN ``--user-data-dir`` — never the user's real Chrome profile.
- Kills ONLY the process it launched (its ``Popen`` handle) — **never** a name-based ``chrome.exe``
  sweep, which would close the user's real browser.

Trade-off vs the stealth tiers: it's a genuine Chrome (webdriver=false) but is NOT
fingerprint-patched, so it suits a **human-driven** login rather than fully-headless scraping.
Selected via ``router.get_browser(engine="chrome")``.
