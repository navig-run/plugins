"""Firefox browser engine — a **non-CDP** stealth tier (Juggler protocol, not CDP).

Why Firefox exists alongside the Chromium tiers: some anti-bot stacks fingerprint the
**CDP/Chromium automation surface itself**. Patchright, despite its stealth patches, still
drives Chromium over CDP, so it still carries that class of artifact — which is exactly what
TikTok's web-login *region* check flags (the region call dies with ``net::ERR_FAILED`` in the
automated Chromium browser). Playwright's Firefox is driven over Firefox's **Juggler**
protocol, so those CDP artifacts don't exist and the whole detection class is sidestepped.

Two engines behind one controller:
- ``engine="firefox"`` (default) — **Playwright Firefox**: reliable, cross-platform, and
  navig-managed (the binary is auto-provisioned on first use, the same way Chromium is).
- ``engine="camoufox"`` — **Camoufox**: a C++-patched Firefox with an engine-level coherent
  fingerprint + geoip. Opt-in (``pip install camoufox && python -m camoufox fetch``); raises a
  clear error if its binary isn't present.

The interface mirrors ``StealthController`` (``start`` / ``stop`` / ``.page`` / ``.context``) so
it drops into the same call sites (login flows, session capture). Session state round-trips
through NAVIG's vault via the standard Playwright ``storage_state``, so a session captured in
Firefox restores into any other engine. Selected via ``router.get_browser(engine="firefox")``.
