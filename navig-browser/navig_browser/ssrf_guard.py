"""SSRF route-guard for Playwright browser automation.

Validating only the *entry* URL is not enough for a real browser. Playwright follows
HTTP redirects, ``<meta refresh>`` and JS ``location=`` on its own, and loads whatever
subresources (images, scripts, ``fetch``/XHR) the page asks for — none of which passed
the entry check. So a public URL the agent was steered to (by a prompt-injection riding
model output, or a malicious page) that ``302``s to ``169.254.169.254`` (cloud metadata)
or the local daemon would be rendered and its content read back to the model.

This installs a request interceptor that re-validates **every** in-page request against
the SSRF policy and aborts the blocked ones. Install it on a Playwright ``BrowserContext``
(covers every current and future tab/page) or a single ``Page``. Verdicts are cached per
host for the life of the target — DNS is blocking and pages hit the same hosts repeatedly.
Unverifiable ⇒ blocked (**fail closed**): a host we cannot resolve is one the browser could
not have safely reached anyway.

Secure by default; local/LAN hosts are reachable only when the operator sets
``net.ssrf.allow_private_network`` (via ``policy_from_config``), exactly like every other
navig SSRF surface (``safe_fetch``, ``ics_calendar``, ``browser_fetch``).
