"""NAVIG Vault Migration — upgrade legacy credentials/vault.db to the new vault.

Source : ~/.navig/credentials/vault.db  (Fernet + PBKDF2, old schema)
Target : ~/.navig/vault/vault.db         (AES-GCM + Argon2id, new schema)

The source is never modified or deleted. Nothing needs to be run by hand: ``get_vault()``
triggers this on first use through ``_auto_migrate`` when a legacy store is present and
the marker is absent. The docstring used to name a CLI verb that has never existed.
