"""Video assembly — turn a pile of clips, stills and a soundtrack into one deliverable.

The sibling of :mod:`navig_generate.media.audio_edit`, and deliberately built the same way:
subprocess ffmpeg (no binding to go stale), an explicit timeout on every call, and a
refusal to report success for a file that is not there or is the wrong length.

What it is for is vertical short-form — 1080x1920 for TikTok / Shorts / Reels — so two
opinions are baked in:

* **Fill and crop, never letterbox.** Black bars on a phone read as an upload mistake,
  and on TikTok they collide with the UI chrome. :func:`to_vertical` always fills.
* **Hard cuts by default.** Fast cutting holds attention on a feed; crossfades are
  available via ``transition="xfade"`` but they are not the default for a reason.

⚠ The single sharpest edge in here is :func:`burn_captions`. ffmpeg's ``subtitles``
filter parses its own argument, so a Windows path (``C:\\x``) is read as a filter
option separator plus an escape sequence, and it fails with a message about neither.
:func:`escape_filter_path` is the fix and is tested on its own.
