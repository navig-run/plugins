"""Audio editing — change speed, with or without changing pitch.

Two different things people mean by "slow it down", and conflating them is the whole
reason this module exists rather than one ffmpeg flag:

* **tempo** — play it slower, keep the voices/instruments at the same pitch. ffmpeg's
  ``atempo``. This is what you want for a lecture at 1.5x or a voice note at 0.8x.
* **rate** — play the samples slower, so the pitch drops with it. ffmpeg's ``asetrate``.
  This is the "slowed" aesthetic (and what a tape machine does), and it is NOT what
  ``atempo`` produces.

``speed()`` does the first, ``slowed()`` the second.

The other half of this module is **assembly**: :func:`concat` joins clips into one file
and :func:`normalize` masters the result to the broadcast loudness target. Together they
are what turns a pile of separately-generated clips into something publishable, and
:func:`probe_duration` is how anything downstream (chapter marks, subtitle offsets)
learns where each piece actually landed.

⚠ ``atempo`` accepts a factor of **0.5–2.0 per instance**. A naive
``atempo={rate}`` therefore silently fails (older ffmpeg) or is rejected outright for
anything outside that window — so 0.25x and 4x, the two most obvious things a user
tries first, are exactly the cases a one-liner gets wrong. :func:`tempo_chain` splits
any positive factor into a chain of in-range ones whose product is the request.
