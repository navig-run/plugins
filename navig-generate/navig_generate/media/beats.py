"""Where the beat is — onset detection and beat tracking, ffmpeg + numpy only.

:mod:`navig_generate.media.fx` has taken beat times since it was written: :func:`~navig_generate.media.fx.punch_in`
pulses the frame on them and :func:`~navig_generate.media.fx.glitch` tears on them. Nothing in navig
ever computed any. Every caller passed the *cut* boundaries instead and called them beats,
which lands the effects on the edit rather than on the music — the one thing short-form
viewers read instantly as "this was not cut to the song".

This closes that. It is deliberately dependency-light: ffmpeg to decode and numpy to
analyse, both of which navig already requires. librosa would be the obvious import and a
heavy one for three hundred lines of DSP.

The chain is the standard one, and each step is here because the previous one is not
enough on its own:

1. **Decode** to mono float32 at a low rate — pitch is irrelevant, timing is not.
2. **Spectral flux** — sum only the frames where energy *rose*. Total energy peaks at the
   loudest moment, which in dense music is nowhere near the transient.
3. **Normalise and subtract a local mean** — a track that gets louder must not read as a
   track with more beats.
4. **Tempo** by autocorrelating that envelope, weighted toward human tempi so a strong
   half- or double-time lag does not win on arithmetic alone.
5. **Beat tracking** by dynamic programming (Ellis 2007): every beat is scored against the
   onset envelope *and* penalised for deviating from the tempo period, so the grid stays
   steady across a bar the drummer left empty. Picking local peaks instead drifts on any
   syncopation, which is most of the music this will ever see.
