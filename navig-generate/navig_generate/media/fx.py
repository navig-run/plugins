"""Motion and texture — the layer that separates a slideshow from a cut.

:mod:`navig_generate.media.video_edit` can assemble a correct vertical video: right size, right
length, captions clear of the app's chrome. Correct is not the same as watchable. What
short-form actually rewards is *motion* — a push on the beat, a caption that arrives word
by word, grain that makes a clean render look shot rather than exported.

Everything here is a **pure function returning an ffmpeg filter fragment**. Nothing runs
a subprocess, nothing touches a file. That is deliberate and it is what makes the module
testable: a filtergraph is a string, so the tests assert the string, and only the handful
of functions in ``video_edit`` that actually execute need ffmpeg on the machine.

Fragments compose left to right through :func:`chain`, which is just a comma-join that
drops empties — so a look can switch an effect off by passing ``0`` rather than by
branching at every call site.

⚠ Two hard-won constraints inherited from ``video_edit``, repeated because breaking them
is silent rather than loud:

* **Subtitle coordinates are not video coordinates.** A plain SRT carries no PlayRes, so
  libass assumes a 288-tall script; one ``MarginV`` unit is ~6.68 video pixels at 1920.
  :func:`caption_style` converts for you — never pass raw pixels to force_style.
* **Effects belong on beats and cuts, not on everything.** Grain plus shake plus glitch
  running continuously reads as amateur, not cinematic. The defaults here are
  deliberately restrained; a look that wants more should say so explicitly.
