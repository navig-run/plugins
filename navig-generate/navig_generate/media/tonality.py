"""What a track *is* — key, loudness shape, spectral balance — ffmpeg + numpy only.

:mod:`navig_generate.media.beats` answers *when* (tempo, beat times). This answers the questions a
producer asks before writing a beat "like that one": what key is it in, how is the low end
built, where does the arrangement drop out, how loud does it sit. The output is a
:class:`AudioProfile` — numbers first, then a sentence a music model can be handed as a
style brief. Nothing here is taste; every field is measured.

Kept as light as :mod:`beats`: one decode through ffmpeg, an STFT in numpy, and the
Krumhansl–Schmuckler key profiles, which are two lists of twelve numbers. librosa would do
the same in fewer lines and cost a hundred megabytes of wheels.
