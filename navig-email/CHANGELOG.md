# Changelog — navig-email

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **Requires `navig>=3.25.0`.** 0.1.0 declared `navig>=3.24.0`, and the published navig 3.24.0
  does not contain modules this package imports — `core/pyproject.toml` had said 3.24.0 for 541
  commits, so the source and the wheel answering to that number were different code. Installing
  with the navig it asked for produced `ModuleNotFoundError`: immediately if the import was at
  module scope, otherwise the moment the feature ran. navig 3.25.0 contains them, and
  `scripts/check_plugin_core_floor.py` now checks every declared floor against the file list of
  the wheel it actually selects.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-01

First changelog entry. This package existed before this file did, so earlier
history lives in the monorepo's git log rather than being reconstructed here —
an invented history would be worse than an honest starting point.

### Packaging
- Declares its dependency on `navig` (or deliberately does not, if it runs
  standalone) and ships the full licence text in the wheel.
